Collaboration is key when teams are working on services. When we did research into some of the problems with working together in government, near the top of the list was wifi. When people visited other buildings, or started a new role, it could be difficult or impossible to just get on the internet.

GovWifi is a huge and successful project that is now available in most government buildings. Users only have to sign up once, and then they will automatically connect wherever they go. A great example of a service that 'just works'.

## My role

As part of a multidisciplinary team, I led the service and interaction design. Some examples of my work includes:

 - Mapping out and designing the service, for example posters and other documentation available in each building to let people know how to get on GovWifi

 - Helped resolve a key issue about access. When GovWifi first launched, some buildings allowed any users, others restricted it to civil servants. This led to confusion, especially when people moved between buildings. We worked closely with IT teams to address their concerns and made GovWifi available to anyone in any building.

 - Designed a self service admin UI. This let IT teams start providing GovWifi far quicker, and help them control their network and resolve any issues directly.

 - With great work from the whole team we took the 'Live' government service assessment and passed.
