# GOV.UK Prototype Kit

<img src="/assets/images/govuk-prototype-kit-tutorial.png" alt="">

The GOV.UK Prototype Kit is a unique prototyping tool that lets teams create and test designs quickly. It produces real web pages, meaning you can get a feel for and test realistically in the browser.

Crucially this includes being able to test with accessibility tech such as screen readers to ensure from the start that designs work for disabled people.

It is widely used by teams across government and beyond, and is a key part of the [GOV.UK Digital Service Platform](https://platforms.service.gov.uk)

## My role

I created the kit with my colleague Tom Byers during our work on Register to Vote. I then led the design and development of the kit, and provided training and support.
